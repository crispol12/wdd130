      <p>Hello! My name is Christian Castillo, I am from Otavalo, Ecuador. I enjoy to sing, My favorite food are salads in special chicken salad. I am exciting to this opportunity in BYU. 
        I am Ecuadorian, and my country is a beautiful place in South America, known as one of the 20 megadiverse countries in the world. 
        The Andean mountain range is one of the highest mountain ranges in the world and is the longest worldwide.Otavalo, where I live, is a small, very beautiful city, 
        famous worldwide for the Plaza de Ponchos, a park filled with a craft market. It is a very cultural city where all tourists are welcome. 
        The Quito Temple is a point of interest for the people of my city because it is very close and allows us to go to the holy place to be with our Heavenly Father. 
        Many people think that Ecuador is an African country, but in South America, it is recognized as a tourist powerhouse and the only country that has the dollar as its official currency. 
        This makes it an attractive destination to visit and explore its regions and beautiful landscapes.</p>
